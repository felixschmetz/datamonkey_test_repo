## Global Whispers

Oceans hum in pentatonic scales, mountains trade postcards, and pocket universes open pop-up shops for glow-in-the-dark ideas. No claims, just vibes.

## Markets of Imagination

Confidence futures rise on a rumor that optimism learned to juggle; skepticism sells limited-edition question marks. Currency of the day: compliments.
