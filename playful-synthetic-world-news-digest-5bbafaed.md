## Overture

Welcome to the Fantasia Gazette, where clouds file press releases and calendars cheer from the sidelines. Official stamp: 5bbafaed. Everything you read here is delightfully pretend.

## Headlines That Wink

Continents performed a coordinated wave, coffee cups unionized for refills, and inboxes celebrated Inbox Zero by creating more zeroes. Diplomats traded high-fives for low-latency vibes.

## Weather of Feelings

A drizzle of sparkles moved eastward, followed by a cold front of chill playlists. Umbrellas opened themselves purely for the drama.

## Markets of Imagination

The Index of Joy ticked up three chuckles, while the S&P (Snacks & Puns) closed at a crunchy all-time rhyme. Volatility measured in confetti per minute.

## Sportsball & Shenanigans

Teams of indeterminate size scored creatively as referees issued citations for insufficient whimsy. Final score: to be continued, indefinitely.

## Techno-Gossip

Gadgets taught themselves to nap responsibly, while algorithms practiced interpretive dance. Version numbers agreed to stop trying to be pi.

## Culture & Quirks

Book clubs discussed blank pages to appreciate silence, and streaming services released a show about buffering, which refused to end.

## Closing Credits

Thanks for tuning into a universe where news is a playground. Remember: if it made you smile, it did its job.
