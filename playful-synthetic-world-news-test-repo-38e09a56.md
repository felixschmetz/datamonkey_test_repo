Welcome to the Playful Planetary Press, where headlines pirouette and facts take a gentle nap. In today's entirely invented chronicle, the Moon opened a pop-up tea shop for stargazers, and breezes practiced cursive on kites. A curious stamp labeled 38e09a56 keeps appearing on paper airplanes—rumored to be the secret handshake of jubilant raccoons. Markets? Made of marbles. Politics? Polka-dot umbrellas negotiating with sunbeams. Sports? Millipedes set a record in synchronized shoelace tying. Weather? Confetti with a chance of applause.
